# TodoFinder

A simple command line tool for finding TODOs in a codebase and outputting them in a clean, readable way.

It's pretty rough. It could be a grep for sure. Do I care? Nahhhh.

I'm sorry.

## Installation

    $ gem install todo_finder

## Usage

Run the `todo` command to find all TODOs in the current directory

    $ todo

Optionally specify a directory to search for TODOs:

    $ todo my_technical_debt/lib

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
